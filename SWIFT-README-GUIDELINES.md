# Swift open-source README documentation guidelines

You can check out a well-documented README example [here](https://github.com/inaka/Jayme/blob/master/README.md).

---

### i. Mandatory

Ideally, your `README.md` file must include:

- An emphasized **title** standing out your **library's name**.


- A **slogan** or single sentence below the title describing your library in few words.
- An **Overview** section describing briefly what your library does in simple terms, without entering into implementation details.
- Either:
  - **Diagrams** to show the architecture of your library, or to explain basic concepts relevant to the usage of the library.
  - Or **Animated GIFs** if your library is meaningful from a UI point of view.

- An **Example** section showing relevant chunks of code that expose your library usage in few lines.
- A **Sample Project** section giving instructions on how to setup the example project that comes within the repo.
- A **Setup** section giving instructions on how to integrate the library in any project.
- A **Contact Us** section including:
  - A link to our [hipchat open-source room](http://inaka.net/hipchat).
  - A link for opening an issue in your library repo.
  - A link to [inaka.github.io](http://inaka.github.io/).

### ii. Optional

Optionally, to give more chances to your library for becoming popular, you can also include:

- A **logo**, which might replace the title, to give your library a stronger identity.

- **Badges** to expose your library status (e.g. [Travis CI](http://travis-ci.org/), [codecov.io](https://codecov.io/gh), [cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/inaka)).

- A **Features** section describing some features of your library, such as which things it supports, or other outstanding cool features that are worth it to remark.

- A section explaining how your library works in detail.

✍️ You need to know how to work with [**markdown syntax**]().

I personally suggest these 2 mac applications to work with markdown:

- [Typora ](http://typora.io/)when writing documentation and you want preview live.
- [Sublime Text]() when you need to get picky with specific structures in your file (e.g. links, images with links, etc) and live preview becomes annoying.
