## Introduction

Every developer and operations employee at the company will have an scheduled meeting **every 4 weeks** with the CTO.
The goal of such meetings is to keep both the CTO and the dev up to date on the latest news on the technology and projects the dev is working on and also to identify stuff that deserves to be shared with the rest of the Inaka team.

## Checklist

The meetings have no particular agenda, but the following subjects are expected to be covered every time:

- [ ] **Battle Stories**: Hard problems that the developer solved during that month, new libraries he discovered/created/contributed to, lessons learned and basically every bit of new knowledge that deserves to be shared with the team and added to the collective experience of the company.
- [ ] **Open-Source**: Every month, every developer has 1 _open-source day_ to work exclusively on any of the company's open-source projects. During the monthly meetings it's expected to evaluate the work done during that day in the previous month and decide what to do in the upcoming one.
- [ ] **Blog Posts**: Inaka's blog is collaborative (i.e. everybody can and should write articles). If, during the monthly meetings, things that deserve to be shared with the community are detected, the developer is assigned the task of turning such stories into blog posts during the upcoming month.
- [ ] **Talks**: Every Friday, after Inaka's communitary lunch, someone gives a lightning talk. In monthly meetings, subjects for such talks are identified and upcoming lightning talks about them are scheduled.
