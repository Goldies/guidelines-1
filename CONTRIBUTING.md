## How to contribute

If you feel this list of guidelines could benefit from a new item, or some other modification, we would like to know!

Suggestions should be added as [Github issues](issues) in this same repository.

When discussed and approved there, it should be turned in a PR. You can use [aw](http://github.com/inaka/assisted_workflow) for that.
