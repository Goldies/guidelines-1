## Introduction
Every day at 11AM (ART) we do our _daily standup_ in the Inaka hipchat room.
The daily is supposed to function as an alternative for an in-person daily standup, which can be inefficient and time consuming. It is designed to serve as a brief description to improve both communication between your team members and assists with project planning.
It also serves as a _meeting point_ where we **know** everybody will be in, so
if you want to _broadcast_ some news or you want to ask something to _everybody_, that's the place to do it.

## Daily Format
Below you'll find an overview of what to include in your daily and the format you should use:

The daily is a one-line sentence description of your tasks for the present day.
It may optionally include something about your accomplishments for the previous
days, if you feel like sharing.

### What to cover in your daily
* _(optional)_ Summarize what issues you worked on yesterday.
* **_(required)_** What issues you’re working on today.
* _(optional)_ Mention any blockers.

### Daily Examples (taken from our best devs at hipchat):
  |   |   |
---|---|---|---
**Ignacio Mendizabal** | Daily: scale testing of conflux and announce i'm gonna be father. | ``11:03 AM``
**Iñaki Garay** | daily: finishing choosy image processing robustification and starting an epic bughunting rampage | ``11:33 AM``
**Marcelo Gornstein** | daily: working with @amilcar on the erlang factory talk and sumodb, also discussing ac improvements for data loading with @brujo and the tt guys, also some code review for jay | ``10:55 AM``
**Hernán Rivas Acosta** | daily: resulta q tenia q agregar una feature, no viene al caso q, pero básicamente agregaba una lista de usuarios a las organizaciones q representaba los flacos q se querían unir, pero q no están aceptados x el admin aun. La lógica de login esta x todos lados, entonces agregar eso era un lío. Me puse a reescribir muchas cosas y solucione varios bugs y ahora, tengo  mas de 1000 lineas en el PR | ``11:11 AM``

## Tools
Every day at 10:55AM (ART), **DailyGuy** (a chat bot) will remind all to
publish their daily. It will check for uninformative or missing dailys every 15' after that, and ask the ones responsable for those messages to add/improve their comments. So, there is no reason for devs to not share their daily's at 11 AM each day.
