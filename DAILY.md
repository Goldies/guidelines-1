## Introduction
Every day at 11AM (ART) we do our _daily_.
The daily is supposed to function in place of a daily standup, which can be
inefficient and time consuming. It is designed to be a brief description that
both improves communication between your team members and assists with project
planning.
It's also meant as a _meeting point_ where we **know** everybody will be in, so
if you want to _broadcast_ some news or you want to ask something to _everybody_
that's the place to do it.

## Daily Format
Below is an overview of what to include in your daily and the format:

The daily is a one-line sentence description of your tasks for the present day.
It may optionally include something about your accomplishments for the previous
days, if you feel like sharing.

### What to cover in your daily
* _(optional)_ Summarize what issues you worked on yesterday
* **_(required)_** What issues you’re working on today
* _(optional)_ Mention any blockers

### Daily Examples (taken from our best devs at hipchat):
  |   |   |
---|---|---|---
**Ignacio Mendizabal** | Daily: scale testing of conflux and announce i'm gonna be father. | ``11:03 AM``
**Iñaki Garay** | daily: finishing choosy image processing robustification and starting an epic bughunting rampage | ``11:33 AM``
**Marcelo Gornstein** | daily: working with @amilcar on the erlang factory talk and sumodb, also discussing ac improvements for data loading with @brujo and the tt guys, also some code review for jay | ``10:55 AM``
**Hernán Rivas Acosta** | daily: resulta q tenia q agregar una feature, no viene al caso q, pero básicamente agregaba una lista de usuarios a las organizaciones q representaba los flacos q se querían unir, pero q no están aceptados x el admin aun. La lógica de login esta x todos lados, entonces agregar eso era un lío. Me puse a reescribir muchas cosas y solucione varios bugs y ahora, tengo  mas de 1000 lineas en el PR | ``11:11 AM``

## Tools
Every day at 10:55AM (ART), [DailyGuy](/inaka/dailyguy) will remind all to
publish their daily. It will check for uninformative or missing dailys every 15'
after that, and ask the ones responsable for those messages to add/improve their
comments. So, there is no reason for devs not to share their dailys at 11AM each
day.
